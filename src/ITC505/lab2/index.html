            1. ABSTRACT
        </h2>
        <p>
            People usually avoid buying wearables like clothes, ornament, etc. online mainly because it's hard to judge whether it will look good on them or not. 
            To solve this problem, we decided to build a Virtual Trial Room Application. Our approach concentrates on how the selected garment fitted the user’s 
            body and how it will be appear on user in real world. This was carried out by identifying critical points on garment and user’s body dimensions using 
            image processing techniques. This application is implemented using augmented reality with the help of Kinect sensor. Augmented Reality is direct and 
            indirect view of real-world elements that are augmented on computer software. It mainly adds the software information and refines the users view to actual environment.

            2.  INTRODUCTION
        </h2>
        <p>
            <b>AUGUMENTED REALITY</b> along with <b>KINECT SENSOR.</b> Augmented reality is the technology that expands our physical world, adding layers of digital information onto it. 
            Augmented reality adds digital element to live view by using cameras or sensors.
            <br> 
            Kinect sensor is a line of motion sensing input devices that was produced by Microsoft. Kinect has resolution of up to 1280x1024, monochrome depth sensing video stream is in 
            VGA resolution with 11-bit depth. This sensor will give video frames as input to system for finding the available dresses in database.

            3. LITERATURE REVIEW
        </h2>
        <p>
            1. <b>Md. Farhan hamid, md. Ashraful alam,</b> "virtual wardrobe for physically impaired using microsoft kinect sensor"
            <br>
            This paper throws light particularly on physically impaired people who are partially or completely challenged. 
            For completely impaired people, sensor senses the head movements for iterating through the clothes and the eyes 
            movement for selection of apparel.

            "User experience measurement on virtual dressing room of Madura Batik clothes"
            <br>
            The system proposed in paper is used for online trial of Madura Batik clothes which is the regional wear of Indonesia. 
            It provides virtual reality trial room for foreign customers to change consumer shopping experience and increase buying desire
        </p>
        <h2>
            4. EXISTING SYSTEM
        </h2>
        <p>
            Augmented reality is being used in wide areas mentioned below
            <ul>
                <li>Medical Training</li>
                <li>Design & Modeling</li>
                <li>Business Logistics</li>
                <li>Education</li>   
                <li>Gaming</li>
            </ul>
            The existing application are implemented using OpenCV and web camera to capture video. Once the video is captured, 
            it identifies the background and object of human and changes the color of the glasses and adds the selected glasses 
            according to the users’ choice. This application use OpenCV for identifying the user and to change the color and spectacles 
            according to user's choice.
            <br>
            <br> 
            It is an platform basically designed for achieving computational efficiency and also to give emphasis for real time applications. 
            When comes to online Business, most popular eye wear websites lens kart and titan eye+ and other websites are using this technology.

            5. PROPOSED SYSTEM
        </h2>
        <p>
            Above are the eye wear websites, but here we are implementing in an E-Commerce websites. E-Commerce websites are having lot of collections to shop. 
            When we shop online we don’t know whether the dress suits us or not. Customer satisfaction and even this pandemic situation has taken into consideration, 
            we got an idea to implement virtual trial in the E- commerce sites.
            <br><br>
            However, the OpenCV technique is not that accurate in virtual dressing. 
            Here we are going to implement virtual trail room application with a gaming software UNITY 3D and C#. Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies, 
            The engine can be used to create three-dimensional, two-dimensional, virtual reality, and augmented reality games, as well as simulations and other experiences. 
            The engine has been adopted by industries outside video gaming, such as film, automotive, architecture, engineering and construction. And we need a Vuforia SDK, 
            this is a software development kit which enables augmented and mixed reality in Unity engine

            6. APPLICATION APPROCH
        </h2>
        <p>
            The application design approach follows the below steps.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>The user will open the application and selects the gender</li>
            <li>Next there will be a holography which a user should take his/her picture with perfect fit in holograph.</li>
            <li>3After clicking a perfect picture user will be able choose the garments.</li>
            <li>When the user chooses any garment, the application will show a 3D alignment of the dress on his/her body.</li>
            <li>The user should select number of garments to purchase and later it will direct to buying options.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>
            7. CONCLUSION
        </h2>
        <p>
            The application is able to track user’s movement and angles with respect to screen to accurately super impose the attire onto the user without having the user to align to the device screen hence improving user experience. 
            The application can be used by online retailers and vendors to sell their wearable products which will surely attract more customers.  The application with the help of the customer (or the person) will carry out the process 
            of trying the clothing fast and easily, and then selecting the best for him/her, which will, consequently, help us to take advantage of the enormous capacity provided by the science of interaction between man and computer. 
            This, in turn, will reflect positively on the seller in terms of selling the products in a comfortable, modern way resulting in better sales and on the customer in terms of speed and comfort in scanning through all available 
            products offered to reach the best decision in choosing clothes.

        <h1>Addendum</h1>
        <p><b>These are the tags I used in above HTML code to structure and present content. <br> Here's a brief explanation of each:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>&lt;article&gt;:</b><br>This tag is like a neat package for content. It's used when you have a piece of information that could stand on its own – think blog posts, news articles, or forum posts.</li>
            <li><b>&lt;div&gt;:</b><br>The "div" tag is like a virtual box that helps organize content. It's handy for styling things with CSS or grouping elements together with JavaScript.</li>
            <li><b>&lt;h1&gt;:</b><br>The "h1" tag is the big title of your page. It's like the headline that grabs your attention. There should only be one on a page for good SEO.</li>
            <li><b>&lt;h2&gt;:</b><br>This is a level down from the main title. Think of it as a subheading. It helps break down your content into sections.</li>
            <li><b>&lt;p&gt;:</b><br>The "p" tag defines a paragraph. It's like grouping sentences together to form a block of text.</li>
            <li><b>&lt;hr&gt;:</b><br>The "hr" tag is like a visual break between sections. It's a line that separates content.</li>
            <li><b>&lt;br&gt;:</b><br>The "br" tag is your line break buddy. It helps you move to the next line without starting a new paragraph.</li>
            <li><b>&lt;b&gt;:</b><br>The "b" tag makes text bold. It's like putting emphasis on words for attention, but without any extra meaning. </li>
            <li><b>&lt;ul&gt;:</b><br>The "ul" tag creates a list with bullet points. It's handy for things where the order doesn't matter.</li>
            <li><b>&lt;ol&gt;:</b><br>The "ol" tag is for ordered lists with numbers or letters. Use it when the order of items is important.</li>
            <li><b>&lt;li&gt;:</b><br>The "li" tag is like each item in a list. It goes inside either an unordered or ordered list.</li>
            <li><b>&lt;img&gt;:</b><br>The "img" tag brings images into the mix. It needs a source (path to the image file) and alternative text for those who can't see the image.</li>
            <li><b>&lt;figcaption&gt;:</b><br>The "figcaption" tag is like a caption for a figure or image. It's used to explain or describe what's going on in the image.</li>
        </ul>
